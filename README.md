This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's onAuthStateChanged function: improper unsubscription leading to potential memory leaks. The bug.js file showcases the problem, while unsubSolution.js provides the correct solution.  Ensure you're properly unsubscribing from the listener when your component unmounts to prevent resource exhaustion.  This is crucial for efficient and reliable Firebase applications.
